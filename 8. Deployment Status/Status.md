## Status

When speaking of IPv6, a question immediately comes up: "How many people
do use IPv6 on the Internet?". Answering this question is fundamental to
get an immediate understanding of the real adoption of IPv6. A recent
overview is presented in
[RFC9386](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9386).

A count of IPv6 users is monitored by various organizations. For
example, both
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ipv6/?tab=ipv6_total_adoption) and
[Google](https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html) provide
statistics on the users that access their services over IPv6.

[Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/internet-station/cyber-attacks/state-of-the-internet-report/ipv6-adoption-visualization)
provides data measuring the number of hits to their content delivery
platform.

[APNIC](https://stats.labs.apnic.net/ipv6) quantifies the use of IPv6 by
means of a script that runs on Internet browsers.

Some statistics on DNS records and reachability for top web sites
may be found at
[Dan Wing's site](https://www.employees.org/~dwing/aaaa-stats/).
These data suggest 29% IPv6 penetration by July 2023.

At the time of writing, there are large discrepancies between data from these and
other sources. In fact there is no well-defined metric for "how many IPv6 users
exist" or "how much IPv6 traffic exists". To take one example, Google
estimates the fraction of Google "hits" that use IPv6, yet Google is very little
used in China so these data cannot represent the true world-wide situation.
Estimates posted to the IETF by Geoff Huston in July 2023 suggest that Google
observes a 7% adoption rate in China, while the APNIC measurement reports 30%.

We show here the APNIC presentation of results, as it comes from a Regional
Internet Registry (RIR) to show the number of the Internet IPv6 users
compared with the total Internet population (in million, see next
table).

A third of the Internet population apparently employs IPv6. It is also
interesting to look at the growth curve. The main indicator here is the
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), which shows a two-digit growth
across the 5-year period 2018-2022.

There is a caveat, though, we may want to consider. The method used by
APNIC cannot be fully employed in China, due to local policy filtering
traffic from abroad. An independent
[Chinese research](https://www.china-ipv6.cn/#/activeconnect/simpleInfo)
reports 713 millions measured IPv6 customers as of September 2022,
against the 220 reported by APNIC. If we add the difference between the
two statistics to the global count, we end up with a Ratio of 43.68% in
September 2022, not that far from the "psychological" threshold of 50%.
