## Status

When speaking of IPv6, a question immediately comes up: 
"How many people do use IPv6 on the Internet?".
Answering this question is fundamental to get an immediate understanding
of the real adoption of IPv6.

The count of the IPv6 users is monitored by several organizations.
For example, both [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ipv6/?tab=ipv6_total_adoption)
and [Google](https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html)
provide statistics on the users that access their services over IPv6.

[Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/internet-station/cyber-attacks/state-of-the-internet-report/ipv6-adoption-visualization)
provides data measuring the number of hits to their content delivery platform.
   
[APNIC](https://stats.labs.apnic.net/ipv6) quantifies the use of IPv6 by means of a script that runs on Internet browsers.

We have selected this latter statistic, as it comes from a Regional Internet Registry (RIR)
to show the number of the Internet IPv6 users compared with the total Internet population (in million, see next table).

A third of the Internet population actually employs IPv6.
It is also interesting to look at the growth curve. The main indicator here is
the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), which shows a two-digit growth across the 5-year period 2018-2022.

There is a caveat, though, we may want to consider.
The method used by APNIC cannot be fully employed in China, due to local policy filtering traffic from abroad.
An independent [Chinese research](https://www.china-ipv6.cn/#/activeconnect/simpleInfo) reports 713 millions measured IPv6 customers as of September 2022,
against the 220 reported by APNIC.
If we add the difference between the two statistics to the global count,
we end up with a Ratio of 43.68% in September 2022, not that far from the "psychological" threshold of 50%.
