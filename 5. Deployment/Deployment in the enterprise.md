## Deployment in the enterprise

Measuring the adoption of IPv6 in the enterprise domain is not straightfoward.
Since it is hard to look at it from the network "inside", one of the few currently avaialble approaches 
is to check the IPv6 readiness from outside the enterprise's network.
[https://fedv6-deployment.antd.nist.gov/cgi-bin/generate-com] provides a method to infer whether 
US enterprises support IPv6 by checking its external services, such as the availability of 
Domain Name System (DNS) AAAA records, of an IPv6-based mail service and of the support of IPv6 on
their website. The same method can be applied to Chinese [http://218.2.231.237:5001/cgi-bin/generate] and
Indian [https://cnlabs.in/IPv6_Mon/generate_industry.html] enterprises.

DNS has a good support in all cases: more than 50% of the enterprises in the three economies considered have AAAA records,
a sign that IPv6 support is generally available. The same cannot be said or the other services that have much lower adoption.
