## Deployment by carriers

All the organizations providing or using Internet connectivity services have an associated Autonous System Number (ASN).
APNIC (https://blog.apnic.net/2022/01/06/bgp-in-2021-the-bgp-table/) provides statistics on the evolution of IPv6 support across the ASNs in the world, as observed in the Internet routing tables.

The percentage of IPv6-capable ASNs is growing over the years, which is a ggod sign.
On the other hand, the table does not allow to understand the degree of adoption across the different industries, that is whether the ASNs are associated to a carrier, a service provider or an entreprise.
To zoom in at that level, it is necessary to look at more detailed statistics such as those provided by Akamai (https://www.akamai.com/internet-station/cyber-attacks/state-of-the-internet-report/ipv6-adoption-visualization) or APNIC (https://stats.labs.apnic.net).

Not unsurprisingly, the vast majority of carriers worldwide already support IPv6. Yet, differences exist.
As a general rule, the carriers active in those countries with higher IPv6 adoption also show higher levels of IPv6 utilization.
For example, IPv6 adoption in the United States is 51%. Carriers such as AT&T, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon all exceed 70% of IPv6 use in their networks.
In europe, both Belgium and Germany reach 50% of IPv6 traffic. Proximus, Telenet, DT, Telefonica Germany, Versatel and Vodafone Germany range from 50 % to 70%.
India shows 51% IPv6 adoption. Carriers there also have high IPv6 rate. Bharti, Reliance Jio and Vodafone India find themselves between 60% and 70%.
