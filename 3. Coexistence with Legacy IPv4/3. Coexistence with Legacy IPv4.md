# Coexistence with Legacy IPv4

The notion of a utopian IPv6-only world is a noble goal. However, as with any tectonic change, it happens slowly, and differing elements exist simultaneously.  As such, expectations should be set that in many cases coexistence with legacy IPv4 is the norm, and while it should be considered a transitional state, it may exist for extended or indefinite periods of time. Reasoning for coexistence will vary and is typically only locally relevant to a given environment. It may be due to the requirement for legacy hardware with no IPv6 support that requires capital expenditure beyond the budget of an organization, such as a specialized piece of operational technology, or it may be due to lagging compliance regulations that have not tracked current technology standards. It may simply be the conclusion from a cost/benefit analysis. Regardless, the reasonings are less important than the details necessary to support a dual-stacked environment.

Before describing the specific techniques for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence  -- dual stacks, tunnels, and translators -- it is useful to answer a basic question that newcomers sometimes have: *Why isn't IPv6 backwards compatible with IPv4?* The answer is quite simple: this is a mathematical impossibility. IPv4 contains no provision for any address length other than 32 bits. Stretching the address length by only one bit, let alone by 32 or more bits, would completely break all existing IPv4 implementations. The only solution was a new version number, and in 1994, the next free number was 6. (IPv5 was a failed experiment.)

Given that fundamental incompatibility, the designers of IPv6 decided to meet a number of requirements that IPv4 could never satisfy, and to develop a co-existence model from the start. In short, a *dual stack* means that hosts and routers are able to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time. *Tunnels* means that IPv6 hosts can talk to each other over an IPv4 network, by encapsulating their packets, and vice versa. *Translation* means that, in a limited way, an IPv6 host can talk to an IPv4 host via a translation box. The following sections discuss those three methods of co-existence in more detail. A final section lists some mechanisms that are no longer recommended.

We first give two quite general references for this complex topic: 

1. Although a few years old, [RFC6180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6180) gives useful guidelines for deploying various IPv6 transition mechanisms. 

2. A common tactic today for operators wishing to simplify their infrastructure is to provide IPv4 as a *service* over the top of an underlying IPv6 layer. Various ways to achieve this are described in [RFC9313](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9313).

As networks migrate away from IPv6 and into an IPv6-only environment, they will undoubtedly discover unexpected hurdles consisting of half-completed protocol stacks, lack of capabilities, and unexposed configuration knobs. These will almost certainly be discovered in the periphery of the network. Elements such as power controllers, optical multiplexing platforms, mechanical control systems, and other speciality hardware tend to possess a very long mean time to replacement, and a slow to modernize firmware offering. Operational technologies and SCADA systems are also very slow to update and may also live in the network for many years, if not decades. In domestic networks, old network appliances may persist for many years. With that acknowledgment, it should be expected that there will exist one or more enclaves that differ in their network addressing schema.   

- IPv4 only enclaves
Areas where IPv6 simply is not possible or desirable for compliance, technological, policy, budgetary, or other strategic reasons may operate as an IPv4-only or Legacy IP enclave. This may be the result of migration happening around the enclave, or it may be an intentionally created segment for housing legacy services, devices, or application stacks. It is important to accept that there may be long-lived enclaves where legacy IPv4 is a hard requirement. This fact should inform policy,however, in an ideal situation not necessarily define it. 

- IPv4-IPv6 dual stack
    - Supporting ships in the night protocols
        - Consistent policy
        - Monitoring and measurement
        - Multi-topology within the internet
