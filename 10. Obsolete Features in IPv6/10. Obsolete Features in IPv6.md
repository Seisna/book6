# 10. Obsolete Features in IPv6

This chapter lists a number of IPv6 features that can be considered
obsolete or unused, even if in some cases the relevant RFCs have not
been formally obsoleted. Readers are advised to ignore these techniques
for new deployments, and to consider removing them from existing
deployments.

Older IPv4/IPv6 coexistence mechanisms are described in
[3. Obsolete techniques](../3.%20Coexistence%20with%20Legacy%20IPv4/Obsolete%20techniques.md).
