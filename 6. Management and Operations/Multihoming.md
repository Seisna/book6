## Multihoming

Multihoming means configuring a site in such a way that it is
connected via more than one link to the Internet, preferably via
different ISPs, usually to provide redundancy in case of failures.
The phrase "multihoming with multiple providers" (MHMP) is sometimes used.
The previous section describes the problems with achieving MHMP
using multiple address prefixes. This section describes practical
techniques for multihoming.
