# Management and Operations

*This chapter is at an early stage and is expected to grow dynamically over time*.

Management and operations is a complex topic not just for IPv6, but for information technology in general. Because there are many types of networks consisting of a myriad of components, naturally operations and management will vary based on the use cases, environments, policies, and budgets of any given network ecosystem. To understand how to manage a given resource, it is imperative that there exist an understanding of that resource, and how it is to be used. Most networks can be broadly categorized into one of a small number of general types: Carrier, Personal, Enterprise, Mobile, and Data Center. There are obviously more subtle categories, but in order to maintain an element of completeness, these five categories will encompass the broad spectrum of networks in use today. 

Because most networks are comprised of similar elements and that the core function of a network is to connect endpoints and to deliver data, it is expected that there is overlap in these categories. 

*Carrier*

*Personal*

*Enterprise*

*Data Center*

This chapter starts by describing how various management and operations tools apply to IPv6, and then continues by discussing some specific topics where IPv6 presents its own challenges.
