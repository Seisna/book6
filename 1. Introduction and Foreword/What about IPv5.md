## What about IPv5

Some people ask why IPv4 went to version 6, leaping the next number. And
it was nothing related to programmer's supertition where odd numbers
should be beta releases. Actually, version 5 was assigned for something
called Internet Stream Protocol Version 2
\[[RFC1819](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc1819)\] which never made
it. While we're here, versions 0 through3 were assigned during the
evolution from ARPANET to TCP/IP, and version 7 was used during the
great debates that led to IPv6.
