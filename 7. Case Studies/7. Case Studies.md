# Case Studies

This chapter contains a variety of short case studies, based on real
experience, for a range of network types. It will never be complete, as
every network is slightly different, and it will evolve as time goes on.

This is an __open invitation__ to contribute a case study for this chapter.
If you have deployed an IPv6 network, please write a short section
with emphasis on what major choices you made, what worked well, and
what problems you encountered. Even a summary in one paragraph would be helpful.
Large and small enterprise networks, and large or small carrier networks,
are all of interest. If you have already published such a description,
just a pointer will be fine.
